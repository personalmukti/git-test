# git-test
This is repository for learning git mechanism.

# our goal
With this repository i'll show you how to practically understand how git is working with development system. To develop single working system is need more people to contribute on it. For example analyst, designer, programmer, database administrator, etc. So to bridge all of their work in single repository we need git mechanism. So they will have to do their task personally on their own computer without having so much trouble.

# target
In the end i want all of you to understand how to use git in our project, so any of you will focus and concetrate on your task without bothering any other contributors. All you have to do is fetching the latest state of our repository. Make your own change on your task area or you can fix other contirbutors work if you find something strange and error.

# note
If you are trying to edit other contributors file and you push it, we'll find a conflict inside and we'll fix it.

# next
For now we will try to make a conflict for file. And i'll show you how we are gonna fix that. By adding this readme.md on our repository there will be a change happen. So please make sure all of you fetch the latest version of this repository.

GOOD LUCK!
